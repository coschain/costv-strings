You can increase the energy value by converting COS to VEST; the energy value will affect the revenue created by you, your likes and the content you liked. The higher the value, the higher the revenue you and your liked content receive. Each like consumes 3.3% of the energy value, but it will recover over time.",
  "stamina_info":"Since most of your behavior in COS.TV (upload videos, follow, unfollow, comment) will be on chain and saved forever, each activity will consume the Contentos main net resources, so each action requires stamina. To ensure that you can use it normally, Contentos main net will give you 100,000 stamina, and as long as the stamina is consumed, it will start to recover; if this can't meet your needs, you can pledge a little COS and get a lot of stamina.",
